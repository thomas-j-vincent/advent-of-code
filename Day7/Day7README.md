# Day 7

## Task 1:

On Day 7 we find ourself in the teleportation room! However, the teleporter seems to be broken and we need to fix it. According to the manual there is an issue with one of the **tachyon manifolds** they work as follows: 
A beam starts from the position **S**, always moving downwards. They pass freely through empty space (.) however if there is a splitter (^) the beam at that position stops and "splits" to the immediate right and immediate left of it. We need to calculate the amount of times our beam gets split.
