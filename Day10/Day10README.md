# Day 10

## Task 1: ##

In day 10 we have a set of machines and a row of buttons, for each machine (line in the input) we have multiple buttons and need to select the smallest number of buttons to turn on all the lights of the machine. However, some buttons control more than one light - and the lights aren't all necessarily off in the first place.

This solution uses sets of indices to simulate the lights, as the program optimises for least button presses this automatically
